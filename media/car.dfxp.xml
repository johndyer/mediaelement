            <p begin="00:05.0" end="00:07.4">would see something<br/>very strange.</p>
            <p begin="00:07.4" end="00:10.5">It would seem as though the<br/>car itself were getting shorter</p>
            <p begin="00:10.5" end="00:14.4">and that time for the person<br/>in the car was slowing down.</p>
            <p begin="00:14.4" end="00:17.3">However, you wouldn't<br/>see these effects</p>
            <p begin="00:17.3" end="00:20.6">until the car began to<br/>approach the speed of light.</p>

            <p begin="00:23.0" end="00:28.6">the car would appear to shrink<br/>to 44% of its usual length.</p>

            <p begin="00:33.9" end="00:36.3">if he traveled along<br/>with a beam of light.</p>
            <p begin="00:36.3" end="00:38.4">He simply couldn't<br/>make the trip</p>
            <p begin="00:38.4" end="00:42.1">for at the speed of light,<br/>length would contract to zero</p>
            <p begin="00:42.1" end="00:44.5">and time would stop.</p>
