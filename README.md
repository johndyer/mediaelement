## Introduction

_MediaElementPlayer: HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` player_

A complete HTML/CSS audio/video player built on top `MediaElement.js` and `jQuery`. Many great HTML5 players have a completely separate Flash UI in fallback mode, but MediaElementPlayer.js uses the same HTML/CSS for all players.

`MediaElement.js` is a set of custom Flash plugins that mimic the HTML5 MediaElement API for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using. 
Instead of using Flash as a _fallback_, Flash is used to make the browser seem HTML5 compliant and enable codecs like H.264 (via Flash) on all browsers.

<a id="migration"></a>
## * What's New on `MediaElement.js` version 3.0

* Introduction of `Renderers`, pluggable code that allows the introduction of new media formats in an easier way.

* Ability to play Facebook, SoundCloud, M(PEG)-DASH using [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) for native support and [dash.as](https://github.com/castlabs/dashas) for Flash fallback.

* Code completely documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) notation.

* Addition of native HLS using [hls.js](https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js) library.

* Updated player for Vimeo by removing the use of `Froogaloop` and integrating the new [Player API](https://github.com/vimeo/player.js).

* Deprecated use of `pluginType` element.
 
* Removed Silverlight shim, as well as IE8 and older browsers support.

* Integration of [JSLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint) to ensure code quality and better error checking for development.

**Notes** 
* Support for `wmv` and `wma` has been dropped since most of the major players are not supporting it as well.
* `ogg` formats wonâ€™t play consistently in all browsers so it is strongly recommended a MP3 fallback for audio, or MP4 for video.
* `wav` formats will only play on Browsers that support it natively since there is currently no Flash fallback to allow them to play in other browsers.
